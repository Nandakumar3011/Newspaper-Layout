                        <p>Sometimes, Internet users land themselves in an uncommon situation where an app or website
                            can be
                            used for both work and personal situations.
                            Well, a young front-end designer was spending up to 13 hours on the site, Codepen for work
                            and
                            her hobby, which unfortunately, is also coding.<br /><br />
                            The designer, whose work includes a To-Do Terrarium, clarified, "Well, I didn't have to use
                            it
                            for work but it was already part of my workflow. It just made sense as it was more
                            efficient.</p>
                        <p>"The biggest issue, she said, is that she would hop on Codepen for work, but would get
                            distracted
                            by pens made by others in the community for unexpectedly long periods of time, which then
                            causes
                            her to spend even more time on the site.<br /><br />
                            "I mean, that's terrible right?" she asked. The best place to
                            build, test, and discover front-end code, has declined to comment at this time.</p>

                        mail</a>. A lot of joke items of things that shouldn't be done in CSS Grid, such as <a

                    a cultured person, you will have a chance to enjoy a couple of pens inspired by <a
